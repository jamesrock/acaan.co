			<h3>the effect</h3>

			<p>any card at any number - a trick that needs no introduction (or does it?).</p>

			<p>deck of cards is presented. participant is asked to freely name ANY card and ANY number (between 1 and 52). after a single cut, the cards are handed to the participant, who then deals-down to their chosen number to find - despite the odds - their chosen card at their chosen position.</p>

			<p>it's as strong as it gets in terms of card trick plots, and is considered by many to be the <em>holy-grail</em> of card magic.</p>

			<p>there are many methods of achieving this trick, but suffice to say, as methods for such tricks go, this is much better than the method used by Derren Brown during his spot on Stand Up To Cancer 2014 (find it on YouTube!) and that method is great enough.</p>

			<h3>the method</h3>

			<p>you'll need a <em>secret hand</em> (an assistant) to perform this trick.</p>

			<p>make a stacked deck matching the stack displayed at the bottom of the main screen - scroll through from start to end. the stack is completely random, unique to you, and is saved to your device so you can use the same stack time and again. a new stack may be generated at any time by pressing 'new stack'.</p>

			<p>when your participant names their card and number, your secret hand, listening-in, inputs the card and number into the app and presses 'calculate'. the card immediately displayed on screen is the card you'll need to cut-to-face to place the chosen card at the chosen position.</p>

			<h3>the ruse</h3>

			<p>the cut-to-face, as clean and direct as it is, does require at least some consideration. it's not complex sleight of hand (far from it!) but you'd be wise to devise a fairly convincing narrative for it to play an insignificant part of a larger routine. play it well and your participant (and possibly audience too!) may well totally forget that you'd handled the cards at all...</p>

			<p>in any case, causally fan through the deck face-up, locate the card and make a single cut-and-complete to make it the face card. then turn the deck face-down in handing it to your participant.</p>

			<h3>ideas</h3>

			<p>if you're stuck for ideas, or could use some inspiration, do consider paying Â£3 for an additional PDF crammed full of ideas covering <em>the ruse</em> and performance variations for stage, tv, closeup and street. i really don't need the money - it's just nice to say thanks, acts as a gate, and might well buy me a ticket to next year's The Session convention which i would never otherwise attend... thanks in advance. <a href="http://paypal.me/rockjames">paypal.me/rockjames</a></p>
